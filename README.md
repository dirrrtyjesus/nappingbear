## Developer Fee and Continuous Improvement
We highly value community support and user satisfaction, and we strive to minimize any inconvenience for our users. To sustain the ongoing development, maintenance, and enhancements of the project, the miner operates with a nominal 1.67% developer fee. This fee is equivalent to the mining rewards earned in the first minute of every hour and is crucial for the continuous improvement of the project.

### Commitment to Excellence
The developer fee serves as a reinvestment into the project, allowing us to enhance the efficiency of the miner, implement innovative features, and release regular updates to address any potential bugs or issues. We are devoted to delivering an exceptional mining experience and relentlessly work on optimizing the software to ensure you reap maximum mining rewards.

### Option to Contribute and Adapt
Understanding the importance of user choice and transparency, we provide the flexibility to adjust or disable the developer fee. If you decide to contribute a different amount or opt out of the developer fee, you can easily do so when running the miner:

```sh
$ python miner.py --dev-fee-on --dev-fee-seconds [Your Chosen Seconds]
```
By using the `--dev-fee-on` option, you can enable the developer fee, and with `--dev-fee-seconds`, you can specify the number of seconds per hour you wish to contribute, This may not be necessary, the default is 60. If you choose not to use these options, all mining rewards will be directed to your account, with no contributions to the developer. We respect and appreciate your decisions and are always here to assist you with any concerns or questions you may have.

### Community Engagement
Our gratitude extends to the entire community for its unwavering support and active engagement. We encourage and welcome feedback, suggestions, and vibrant discussions as we believe in mutual growth and the shared vision of shaping a prosperous mining future together.

## Building

### Preliminary Setup for Beginners

If you are unfamiliar with the building process or are encountering difficulties, you can run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies. If you are familiar with this process, feel free to adapt according to your preferences.

```sh
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install git cmake make sudo -y
```
Remember, these commands are for Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. Please adapt them according to your operating system if needed.

Note: The sudo command is generally installed by default on most Linux distributions, but it is included in the command just in case it is not present.

### Building from Source

To build from the source, follow the steps below. Please make sure you have `git`, `cmake`, and `make` installed on your system. If not, you can install them using your system's package manager.

Now, proceed with the following steps to clone the repository and build the project:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/shanhaicoder/XENGPUMiner.git 
cd XENGPUMiner
chmod +x build.sh
```

### OpenCL Installation
To enable OpenCL support, you need to install the OpenCL development package. On Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
```
Please adapt the command according to your operating system if it's not a Debian-based system.

### CUDA Installation
For CUDA support, you need to have both the NVIDIA driver and the CUDA Toolkit installed. You can refer to the official [CUDA Toolkit Archive](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) to download and install the CUDA Toolkit suitable for your system.

Before installing the CUDA Toolkit, run the `nvidia-smi` command to check the existing driver installation and verify the compatibility of your driver version with the CUDA Toolkit version you plan to install. If you need to update your NVIDIA driver, please refer to the official [NVIDIA Driver Download](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) page.

Here's a general guideline for installing CUDA:

1. Check your NVIDIA driver installation and version with nvidia-smi.
2. Refer to the official CUDA Toolkit Archive and download a compatible version.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the download page to install the CUDA Toolkit.

### Execute build.sh
Before running the build script, you can specify the CUDA architecture you are targeting by using the -cuda_arch flag followed by your CUDA architecture version. For example, if you are targeting CUDA architecture 6.1, you would run:

``` bash
./build.sh -cuda_arch sm_61
```

When building the project, it is crucial to specify the correct `cuda_arch` value to optimize the performance of your application. This value should correspond to the Compute Capability of your Nvidia GPU.

You can refer to [NVIDIA CUDA GPUs](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute) to find the correct Compute Capability value for your GPU model. Or this is beter: [matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/), make sure you have a higher version CUDA toolkit installed. Once you have identified the right value, specify it with the `-cuda_arch` flag when running the build script, as shown below:

```sh
./build.sh -cuda_arch sm_86  # Example: For a GPU with Compute Capability 8.6
```
If you omit the `-cuda_arch` flag, the build script will default to using `sm_75`. While the script may still run without specifying `cuda_arch`, defining it correctly ensures that you are utilizing your GPU to its full potential.

## Usage

### Preliminary Setup:
Install the necessary Python packages before running the CPU version for the first time:
```sh
